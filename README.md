# YOLOv8 Supervised Camera System

Welcome to the YOLOv8 Supervised Camera System code repository. This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8 neural network architecture to effectively design a supervised camera system.

## Overview

Our camera system is designed to monitor a dynamic environment and identify objects of interest with the help of the YOLOv8 object detection system.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and tracking 
- Effective performance in a variety of lighting and environmental conditions
- Flexibility to monitor multiple objects simultaneously
- Intuitive interface for ease of system management

## Installation

Instructions to install and set up the system are as follows:

1. Clone this repository into your local system.
2. Pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install ultralytics, supervision
3. Replace video or your webcam
4. Create Zone likely a rectangle A B C D with A ( x1,y1), B (x2,y2), C (x3,y3),  D(x4,y4)....
5. Run the installation script.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the system are coming soon.
